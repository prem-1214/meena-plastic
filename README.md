# Meena Plastic Website

Welcome to the "Meena Plastic" website project! This website showcases products and services offered by Meena Plastic. 

## Setup

To get started with the development of this website, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. To start the Tailwind CSS build process, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./style.css --watch
   ```

This will watch for any changes in your `input.css` file and generate the corresponding `style.css` file.

## File Structure

- `input.css`: The main input file where Tailwind CSS directives are defined.
- `style.css`: The compiled CSS output.
- `main.html`: The homepage for the Meena Plastic website.
